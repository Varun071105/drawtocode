# 🎨 Draw to Code

**Draw to Code** is a visual web creation platform where you **draw your website ideas**, and the system **automatically generates clean HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code** from your design. Whether it's buttons, text, images, or layout sections — if you can sketch it, we can code it.

> Made with ❤️ by **Arun Singh**, Founder & CEO
